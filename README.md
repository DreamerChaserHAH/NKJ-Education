NKJ-Education (a.k.a) နိုင်ငံခြားပညာရေး is a FOSS mobile/web application that is dedicated towards young Myanmar nationals in the hopes of sharing educational-related information like:
- the types of institutions available in certain countries
- verified reviews of aforementioned institutions from existing Myanmar students
- financial-related information about the institution and the environment
- possible agencies that are available to help them.

## Ambition

There are multiple objectives that I, <a href="https://github.com/DreamerChaserHAH">Htet Aung Hlaing (Victor)</a> (not the entire Myanmar population), wish to achieve with this project:
1. provides an opportunity for inexperienced Myanmar CS students to contribute in something truly meaningful.
  - IMO, Myanmar nationals are incredibly under-represented in tech industry.
  - By providing an opportunity like this, they would be more willing to reach out to see for what's **possible**.
  - Of course, this repo is open to contributions even if you are not from Myanmar (**HELP**), do hit me up.
2. procuring sponsorship funds from agencies to be redistributed back to exceptional individuals that could help with improving the country's condition.
  - I am certainly not a **hero**, but I know a few individuals who would be great assets to the country if given the chance.
  - I personally have neither the funds nor the time to support them full-time, as I am following my own dreams and personal ambition.
  - Hence, one idea is to create a pseudo-scholarship program that is entirely funded through manual advertisements.

## Technologies

- Compose Multiplatform
  - As Compose Multiplatform is not as verbose as flutter, I personally believe it is good framework to develop this project with
- Cloudflare
  - As cloudflare free account supports unlimited bandwidth and provides an incredibly amazing cdn, I have decided that hosting static content on Compose Multiplatform would be great choice

## Contribution Guide
There are multiple ways to contribute to this repository
### Information Contribution
The key to every application is data. Without data, even the most well-craft application wouldn't serve any functional purpose.
There are multiple ways you can contribute to this repository as an information contributor.
#### University Information
There are a lot of universities in the cloud. Well, <a href="https://erudera.com/universities/">23,626</a> to be exact. It is humanly impossible for me to gain information about all these universities.

*Nope*, I would rather go learn AI/ML.

Hence, I need your help. Right, I am talking to **YOU**.
#### Agencies Information
I am quite certain that there are a number of agencies providing educational consulting services within the country, They can certainly be of extra help for the students hoping to start their educational journey.

Regarding this, do send an email or create a pr with the link attached to the agency. If I got time, I would go and talk directly to them for a possible listing inside the application (to procure the aforementioned *scholarship*)
#### Individual Review
At some point, maybe every single information you know might have already been contributed by somebody else.

*Damn, that sucks*

Yea, I know. But no worries.

You can still voice your opinion about the place you are at to give others a rough idea what it is about.

### Code Contribution

Oh wait, you can code? **WOW** Come on join me in this bandwagon, and create an application that all types of people from Myanmar can use. (old people, young people, even infants! (maybe that's a little bit too much lol))

If you know or want to learn kotlin, just clone the repository. If possible, look at all the issues that are listed, and tackle those ones first.

(As I would say, solve identifed problems first, before creating potential problems xD)

#### Can beginners contribute?

OF COURSE.

I, myself, live on the principle of *learn while doing*. I do not exactly know what I am doing right now, tbh, BUT what I can 100% be sure of is that I will be learning throughout this journey.

And you should too <3.

## Sponsorship Guide

You are free to support me as an individual, or to the *scholarship* program that I mentioned above. It's your choice, and I would appreciate it whichever one you choose.
